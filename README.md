# Simple-Calculator-using-C-switch-case-
🧮 Simple Calculator in C

Hello! 👋

This is a straightforward command-line calculator built using the C programming language. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and finding the remainder. The program utilizes a switch-case structure to handle user-selected operations.
📌 Why This Project?

I created this calculator as a personal project to reinforce my understanding of control structures in C, particularly the switch-case statement. It's a foundational exercise that helped me grasp how to handle user input and implement basic logic in a C program.
✨ Features

    User-Friendly Interface: Prompts guide users through inputting numbers and selecting operations.

    Basic Operations: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.

    Error Handling: Checks for division by zero to prevent runtime errors.

    Clear Output: Displays results in an easy-to-read format.

🛠️ Getting Started
Prerequisites

    A C compiler (e.g., GCC)

Compilation and Execution

    Clone the Repository:
